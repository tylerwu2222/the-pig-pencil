This past school year, I began playing the [NYT Mini crossword]('https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini') with some friends.

For those unfamiliar, The Mini is a 5x5 daily crossword by NYT that looks like this:

I thought it would be interesting to collect the time it took everyone to complete
each daily mini via screenshots and see if I could make some cool visualizations as a result of it.

Here's a diagram of what an example leaderboard looked like and how I converted it to data:

<ImageModal
imgTN={
    <Image src={n2} className="" alt='mini-process'/>
  }
img={n2}
desc='NYT Mini data scraping process'
title='fig. 2'
/>

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Preliminary Sketches'}/>

A simple visualization exercise I've learned this past year in my info viz class
is to come up with as many visualizations as you can from one dataset.
This can be a great exercise for thinking outside the box for creating innovative vizzes.

To start, I begin with some rough sketches:

<ImageModal
imgTN={
    <Image src={n3} className="" alt='mini-sketches'/>
  }
img={n3}
desc='NYT Mini early viz drafts'
title='fig. 3'
/>

Starting with simple graphs helped me get familiar with the type of data I had and how they are commonly visualized.
Once I had this stepping stone, it was easier to think about alterations and alternative ways I could visualize.

After sketching, I created each viz using D3 (and the basic graphs using recharts):

{/* <ScrollspyHeader header={'Basic Graphs'} level={3} include={true}/> */}
### Basic Graphs

I first tried making the most basic linechart using Recharts, and the result looks... messy.

#### Daily Completion Time Per User
<Basic1 />

Side note: it turns out recharts is actually rendering all missing values as 0.

#### Cumulative Completion Time Per User
Recharts' linechart does look a bit better with cumulative stats:

<Basic2 />

Many of my friends (including myself) played mini less and less throughout the year as our classes got busier.
Thus, it could also be interesting to track **when** we play the mini 

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Closing Thoughts'}/>
In a perfect world, I would've captured every day and I might've also screenshotted the actual crosswords for each day
so I could look for relationships between the words/hints and completion time. But I'm human, so I didn't :(

Maybe one day I'll work at NYT and have access to that sort of data...
