<ScrollspyHeader header={'Who is Anthony Fantano?'}/>
For those of you who recognize this man above, but not from music reviews, it might be from this infamous audio clip:

But when he's not being a meme, he's actually a reputable music critic, posting most of his reviews on his youtube channel theneedledrop.

A hallmark element of Anthony's videos are the ~numerical scores~ he gives at the ends of his videos.

The scores range from 0-10, with a special category, "NOT GOOD", which he addresses in this video.
Essentially, it means Anthony thought it was not worth the effort of reviewing,
or he had a low expectation to begin with.

Anthony started reviewing albums in 2008,
and as of July 2021, has reviewed over at least [1] 1400 albums.
That's quite a bit of data, and in this article,
we'll use data scraped from his website to take a look at his reviewing patterns over the years.

Each review clearly holds more nuance than one singular number
and Anthony has stated that his ratings are not always comparable between different artists,
but for the sake of our analysis we will have to make this oversimplification.

At the end of the day, the numbers are just numbers chosen by Anthony,
and this is mostly just a for-fun look at any trends in how that man chooses those numbers.

[1] Not all his reviews are still posted, so my dataset only goes as far back as October 2012.

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Annual Review Statistics'}/>
One of the most immediate questions we might have is, what is his average rating?
And has it changed over the years?

<SVG1 />

Anthony seems pretty consistent in sticking with an average score of about 6 year-to-year.
In fact, the slight downward trend might just be due to an increased number of "Not Good" reviews (which I very arbitrarily deemed as -1).

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Scores by Genre'}/>
Let's see if this consistency holds across genres:

Not as much here, Anthony seems to have some preference for certain genres (nothing wrong with that).
Regardless, when sorted by <input type="button" className="btn-link" id="interactive-link-1" value="number of reviews" />,
we can see experimental, jazz, singer-songwriter, and folk album reviews are Anthony's <b>7th, 11th, 10th, and 8th</b> most reviewed genres respectively.
However, when sorted by <input type="button" className="btn-link" id="interactive-link-2" value="mean score" />,
they take <b>1st through 4th</b>, with a mean score of <b>6.89</b> compared to the other genres with a mean score of <b>6.17</b>.

<ScrollspyHeader header={"Anthony's Favorite Artists?"}/>
Can we paint a caricature of Fantano's favorite and least favorite artists based on his ratings? Who he deems most inconsistent?
Let's look at the stats (with min. n reviews):

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Closing the Case on this Cantaloupe'}/>
OK, closing thoughts:
                                        
Suprisingly, Anthony has been able to maintain his sanity reviewing music for years and continues to give out consistent ratings on the whole.
He certainly has his own favorite genres and artists, but which reviewer doesn't. At the end of the day, critiquing is a subjective practice,
and that's what makes it interesting.

I think he's had a solid career thus far, establishing a unique lane within the review industry.

Overall, I'm thinking a strong 7 to a light 8.
