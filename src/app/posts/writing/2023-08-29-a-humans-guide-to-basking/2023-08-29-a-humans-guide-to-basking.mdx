  So I've been doing the basking thing for a good half-decade now.
I think I started doing it in high school, especially senior year, when I wanted to relax and think about things.
So I just laid myself down on some pavement and felt the sun.
        
  With your eyes closed and nothing to look at, you begin to focus on other senses and the brain starts to go to work.
You can reflect on your how your day has been going, or maybe how your whole life has been going.
Whatever you want really, no one's listening in.

  The first thing your going to want to do is live in an area with lots of sun.
If this isn't possible, begin considering a career that lets you end up in a sunny place.
This is really the key to basking, so if you can't satisfy this first step, consider other hobbies.
Or maybe global warming will start kicking in pretty soon. Then we can all start basking regularly.  

  The next step is finding an ideal location. 
If you have a backyard or porch or somewhere with copious amounts of UV, then that's an easy go to.
You also want to have enough room to lie down on a flat surface, preferably without stray rocks or pebbles to distract you.
If you're a college student, then finding a lawn of grass is really nice option for this. 
Another benefit of college lawns is hearing the muffled chatter while basking. 
It's quite the cozy, insulated experience.
  
  
  The last question is a question of when. My two favorite times are either (a) after a nice meal, when you're already feeling quite sleepy.
Or (b) after you've been in an air-conditioned building that is a few degrees too cool. This is one of the best feelings in the world in my opinion.
It's like being a cold-blooded lizard waking up to the sun prickling each cell on the surface of your scaly skin.

The biggest risk is obviously getting sunburned. Easy fix, put on sunscreen.

Other risks include:

  1. *Getting stepped on.*<br/>**Solution:** pay attention with your ears, then perform an action roll evasive manuever  
  2. *Falling asleep*<br/>**Solution:** set an alarm or be naturally anxious such that you don't need an alarm OR just enjoy the extra sleep and deal with consequences later  
  3. *Feeling kind of baked from all the heat*<br/>**Solution:** bring an umbrella, some ice water, or if you're near a major body of water, jump in said body of water  
  4. *Feeling kind of baked from other factors*<br/>**Solution:** go home, or do whatever you enjoy doing when baked

OK, let's get down to brass tacks. The reason I prefer basking to just laying on a couch inside is two-fold.
  One, you're outside, in nature (potentially), breathing in air that's not from your room.
  Two, the heat really instills a sense of focus and is conducive to thinking, at least for me.
  If you're still not convinced, or more interested in the non-mental benefits, you can also come out looking like a bronze Adonis, (results may vary).
  So go out, touch some grass, and feel the glorious rays of the sun god.
