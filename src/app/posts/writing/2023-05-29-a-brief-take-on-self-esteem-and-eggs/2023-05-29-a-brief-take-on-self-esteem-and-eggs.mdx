I was recently listening to this psychology podcast called Hidden Brain discussing the concept of self-doubt.
It talked a bit about how everyone experiences moments of self doubt and focused quite a bit on the imposter phenomenon, or imposter syndrome,
and this inspired me to write more generally about self-esteem. Something I wanted to write about for a while.
<ScrollspyHeader />

At it's essence, self-esteem is just how we evaluate our own ability. It can be lower, higher, or just about on par with our actual ability.
It's like a measuring stick for what we are capable of accomplishing.
By knowing which tasks we are capable of performing, we can get things done more efficiently,
and who doesn't like getting things done, right?
<ScrollspyHeader />

When self-esteem is high, it can help us push beyond our limits,
take on challenging tasks, and increase the upper limits of our ability.
The problem is when the measure of self-esteem gets a bit **toooo** bloated,
this is when it can become counter-productive, potentially leading to blunders and risky decision making.

Low self-esteem, on the other hand, is a useful indicator for situations that we might want to avoid,
and skills we still need to work on.
It makes sense from a survival perspective that we should avoid risky,
dangerous tasks we aren't currently skilled in.
However, getting too wrapped up in doubt and low esteem can also be counterproductive lead to a state of inaction.
If high self-esteem is the ceiling-raiser, then I think self-doubt can be a valuable floor-raiser,
or at least a floor indicator, (this is where you are, right now).

In the end, like most so things, the best approach is usually somewhere in the middle.
Having a bit of both are necessary to keep that self-improvement mojo moving forward consistently.
Too much of either is a recipe for an eventual bout of questioning everything in your life and all your past decisions.

Something I learned early on in my high school psych class was the idea of external and internal loci of control.
An external locus is when an individual believes their success is dependent mostly on external factors.
It would follow then that their sense of self-worth could also be more tied to external indicators,
like achievements, placements, and praise from others.

And who doesn't like having acknowledgement and physical measures of success?
We do live in a physical world, so it makes sense to strive for physical mementos and responses.
However, relying on these too much can make us lose that drive and sense of control --
there are so many factors that can influence how others view us and how we are acknowledged,
and these can all change on a whim.
So it might be best to look elsewhere to base our self-esteem.

It's like the saying "don't put all your eggs in one basket".
But in this case, it would be as if we put all our eggs in one basket,
and then gave it away to a compete stranger. (The eggs are your self-esteem). (The stranger is other people).

That's why I believe that developing a bit of an internal locus
of self-worth is much more sustainable and consistent alternative for the long run.
It requires a lot more effort, for sure, but the resulting source of self-esteem is much more stable.

The first few steps I would start with are honesty and frequent self-reflection.
When you are frequently asking yourself, **why**, exactly you are doing something,
and why you want to improve at something, it helps put everything else in perspective.
This is easier said than done of course,
but thinking about things differently is the first step for long-term change and potentiatio).
It's still ok to give some of your eggs to strangers,
keeping all your eggs to yourself isn't all to fun (or practical) either.

(Just make sure to keep a few of those eggs for yourself as well, Frank.)
