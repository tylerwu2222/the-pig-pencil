Hi! This is the first entry into what I'm hoping to make a weekly (or at least bi-weekly) series about topics in ecology.
I've always loved ecology since high school, when I first studied it for Science Olympiad. 

The beauty of ecology is that the topics are all interconnected, and there's probably a lifetime's worth of interesting facts and relationships I could talk about. 

That almost makes it hard to choose where to start. Still, we have to start somewhere.
So to kick off this series, I'll talk about a concept that I think represents some big ideas very well: the keystone species .

I've created a lil feature that lets you hover (or hold on mobile) <HoverDefinitionText hoverText={'the definition would appear here...'} link={'https://thepigpencil.com'} linkText={'sometimes with a link'}>highlighted text</HoverDefinitionText> to show a definition and link to more information.

The first time I heard the term "keystone", it was with the term keystone species. 
But now, years later, I actually looked into what a keystone is. It's one of these:


And if you remove it, this happens:


The term was coined by the ecologist Robert T Paine. The story goes that he was studying tide pool communities. 
Namely, a community that looked like this:


Now, for his experiment, he simply took the purple star, the top predator of this ecosystem and

A related theory to keystone species is what's called the "Green Earth Hypothesis". 
It states that the earth is green because of _, in fact, it's really the predators of herbivores that control the herbivore populations which allow for this Green Earth.

There is a central pattern in ecology, of cause and effect. When one population wanes, the other waxes. 
Everything affects everything else, (to some degree), through these chain of events.

<ScrollspyHeader header="can there be more than one?"/>
Well, maybe. With ecology, (and lots of things), there are few absolutes. 

A keystone species is simply one that has a "profound" impact on an ecosystem. 
And it's really up to us to determine what counts as profound or not.

Next time you go for a walk in the park, you can try thinking about the roles different plants, animals, even abiotic members play in an ecosystem.
In fact, next week's piece will be about roles, which in ecology is called a "niche".

I've been wanting to write about ecology for a long time, but was inspired by this book. 
Which was my introduction the origin of the term "keystone species":
