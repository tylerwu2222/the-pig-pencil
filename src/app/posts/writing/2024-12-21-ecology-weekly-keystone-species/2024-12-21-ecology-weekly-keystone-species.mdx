Hi! This is the first entry into what I'm hoping to make a weekly (or at least bi-weekly) series about topics in ecology.
I've always loved ecology since high school, when I first studied it for Science Olympiad. 

The beauty of ecology is that the topics are all interconnected, and there's probably a lifetime's worth of interesting facts and relationships I could talk about. 

That almost makes it hard to choose where to start. Still, we have to start somewhere.
So to kick off this series, I'll talk about a concept that I think represents some big ideas very well: the keystone species .

Note, for this series. I've created a lil feature that lets you hover (or hold on mobile) <HoverDefinitionText hoverText={'the definition would appear here...'} link={'https://thepigpencil.com'} linkText={'sometimes with a link'}>highlighted text</HoverDefinitionText> to show a definition and link to more information.

The first time I heard the term "keystone", it was with the term keystone species. 
But now, years later, I actually looked into what a keystone is. It's one of these:


And if you remove it, this happens:


The term was coined by the ecologist [Robert T Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_T._Paine_(zoologist)). The story goes that he was studying tide pool communities. 
Namely, a community that looked like this:


Now, for his experiment, he simply took the purple star, (Pisaster ochraceus), the top predator of this ecosystem and repeatedly chucked it into the tide. 
(Repeatedly because presumably the sea star kept crawling back. Science requires sacrifice).

A related theory to keystone species is what's called the "Green World Hypothesis". 
It states that the world is green because of predators. 
By controlling the herbivore population, predators are primarily responsible for the "Green World".

There is a central pattern you'll see in ecology, of cause and effect. When one population wanes, the other waxes. 
Everything affects everything else, (to some degree), through these chain of events.

Well, maybe. With ecology, (and lots of things), there are few absolutes. 

A keystone species is simply one that "defines" an ecosystem, where without it, the ecosystem would be "dramatically" different. 
And it's really up to us to determine what counts as dramatic or not.

Now, I'm going to make a weird analogy to machine learning, (that may not click with everyone), but I think it's too good to pass up. 

In machine learning we define models, or simply, equations that predict some result (y) from a set of variables (x1,x2,...). Think back to the equation of a line (y=mx+b).
To provide an example, I could simplify Paine's tide pool ecosystem as something like:

change_in_ecosystem = (presence_of_sea_star) + (presence_of_mussel) + (presence_of_kelp) ...

Now, imagine the "presence" of a species as between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning no members, and 1 meaning = to the initial population size of the species.

If we set the weight of the sea star to 0, (as Paine did when he threw the star repeatedly), we can then measure then change in ecosystem using some numeric representation.

Yet *another* comparison between keystone species and ML modeling is "functional redundancy". Nat Geo explains low functional redundancy as: "if the species were to disappear from the ecosystem, no other species would be able to fill its ecological niche."
This is extremely similar to the concept of "feature importance" in ML. 

Essentially, how "unique" is the impact of a predictor x on the result y. With sea stars, it's difficult to find another predator that can easily step in to clean up mussels. But, with oxygen producers, there might be more than 1 candidate.

Next time you go for a walk in the park, you can try thinking about the roles different plants, animals, even abiotic members play in an ecosystem.
In fact, next week's piece will be about roles, which in ecology is called a "niche".

I've been wanting to write about ecology for a long time, but was inspired by this book. 
Which was my introduction the origin of the term "keystone s    pecies":
