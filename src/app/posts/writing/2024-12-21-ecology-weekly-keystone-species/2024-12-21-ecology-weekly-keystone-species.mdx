Hi! This is the first entry in what I'm hoping to make a weekly (probably less often than that) series about topics in ecology.
I've always loved ecology since high school, when I first studied it for Science Olympiad. 

The beauty of ecology is that the topics are all interconnected, and there's probably a lifetime's worth of interesting facts and relationships I could talk about. 

That almost makes it hard to choose where to start. Still, we have to start somewhere.
So to kick off this series, I'll talk about a concept that I think represents some big ideas very well: *keystone species*.

**Note:** for this series. I've created a lil feature that lets you hover (or hold on mobile) <HoverDefinitionText hoverText={'the definition would appear here...'} link={'https://thepigpencil.com'} linkText={'sometimes with a link'}>highlighted text</HoverDefinitionText> to show a definition and link to more information.

<ScrollspyHeader header="what does keystone mean?"/>
The first time I heard the term "keystone", it was from the term keystone species. 
Years later, I actually looked up what a keystone is. It's one of these:

And if you remove it, this might happen:
<Image src={w2} alt="keystone out of place"/>

So, in terms of ecology, a keystone species is one that "defines" an ecosystem. Where, without it, the ecosystem would be "dramatically" different ([Nat Geo](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/role-keystone-species-ecosystem/)).

<ScrollspyHeader header="who coined the term?"/>
The term keystone species was coined by the American ecologist [Robert T. Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_T._Paine_(zoologist)) while he was a fellow at UW (washington). 
The key experiment that precipitated this term took place in 1963, when he was studying <HoverDefinitionText hoverText={'shallow pools in the rock face that appear when the tide recedes'} link={'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_pool'}>tide pool</HoverDefinitionText> communities. 

In this community, there were two key players: the [California Mussel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_mussel), and the [Purple Sea Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisaster_ochraceus):
<Image src={w3} alt="sea star and mussel"/>

The Mussel eats primarily algae and kelp, the Star eats a little bit of everything, including, importantly, the Mussel.

Paine was curious what would happen if he *removed* the sea star. 

To do this, he used a crowbar to pry up any sea stars, and repeatedly chucked it into the tide. 
(Repeatedly because presumably the sea star kept crawling back.)

After some time, he found that the pools without the stars became <HoverDefinitionText hoverText={'habitats dominated primarily by one species. This can occur naturally or through human intervention.'} link={'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_pool'}>monocultures</HoverDefinitionText> dominated by mussels.

This finding challenged the predominant view in ecology at the time that having diversity in a habitat was enough for a thriving ecosystem.
Paine's experiment suggested that while all species play their role in the ecosystem, some species have more vital roles than others. 
Such that these species have a "cascading" effect on their prey, their prey's prey, and so on... 


<ScrollspyHeader header="trophic cascades (chain reactions)"/>
A central pattern in ecology is relationships. Cause and effect. When a predator population grows, its prey population shrinks, and vice versa. 
Everything affects everything else, (to some degree), whether through direct interaction or some nth-degree interaction. 

To better illustrate this idea, here's a much-simplified "interactive" food web representing a segment of the above tide pool food web.
(Try changing the slider to see how changing the sea star population might hypothetically affect other species.)

<DynamicFoodWeb/>

Removing the starfish in the above network causes *trophic cascade*: changes in population levels that occur at one trophic level can have rippling effects up or down the food chain.
The one that Paine witnessed is called a *top-down cascade*. But if something were to heavily impact the primary producers (plants) of an ecosystem, that would be a *bottom-up cascade*.

In the biological world, it's rare for something to be truly independent from everything else.

Next time you go for a walk in the park, you can try thinking about the roles different plants, animals, even abiotic members play in an ecosystem.
In fact, my next piece will be about these roles, which in ecology is called a "niche".
