Welcome to the second installment of ecology weekly.

After the previous piece about [keystone species](), it's naturally a good idea to discuss the idea of roles, or niches within an ecosystem.
To accompany this piece, here is the instrumental of "Everything in its right place" by Radiohead -- I think it's kinda fitting. Feel free to play it in the background.

<ScrollspyHeader header={"what's a niche?"} />
The word niche derives from the latin word '' for nest, which brings about the idea of place, one of the main aspects of niches. The other is niche as a role.

The concept of niche was first introduced by American ecologist, , when studying Warblers (a type of bird) and  how it nested in jack pine trees:

Circumstance can also be thought of as opportunity. When resources are readily available for a certain role, than a species that can adapt to fit that role will naturally have better access to those resources, and thus survival.

An extreme example of this is the Giant Panda, native to Sichuan province of China:

They were originally carnivorous like other bears, but scientists hypothesize that due to the extreme availability of bamboo, 
those pandas that were able to consume bamboo had better chance of survival, leading to the adaptation that turned them into eventual herbivores.

Due to the low nutritional value of bamboos, pandas need to eat 25 lbs of bamboo each day, the equivalent of 3 large human infants, or one 25 lb dumbbell.

The role that a plant/animal adopts foremost has to do with its physiology, logically. However, as mentioned last week, no organism lives in a vacuum, species compete with each other for resources, and must hide from predators.


<ScrollspyHeader header={"niche through competition"} />
The other aspect of niche is the role, last week I mentioned roles like "plankton eater" or "mussel eater". These are roles that can be fulfilled by multiple individuals/species.

In addition to physiology, competition with other species changes and solidifies niches. For example, if two birds are competing for nesting spots, one must eventually find an edge, and claim that niche. 
The "loser" will then seek another niche it can fulfill, in order for better chances of survival.

This concept is called the ["Competitive Exclusion Principle"], it's kind of neat. Rather than things increasing in entropy, it seems like a situation where things naturally sort themselves out.

<ScrollspyHeader header={"IRL takeaways"} />
As usual, I want to end with some philosophical takeaways you can bring to your own life. If you think of your positions in school, work, or other relationships and find conflict.

Perhaps there are approaches you can take to find a more suitable niche. Of course this doesn't apply to all situations, but it's an interesting thought.

<ScrollspyHeader header={"next week"} />
Next week will be a pretty fun topic (in my opinion). We'll be talking about a fun, wholesome type of relationship: mutualism, where species help each other, improving the others chance of survival.
