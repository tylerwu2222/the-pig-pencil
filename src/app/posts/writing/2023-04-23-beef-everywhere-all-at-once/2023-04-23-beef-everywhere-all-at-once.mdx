  This past year, like every other 2nd gen and beyond Asian American,
I've watched Everything, Everywhere, All at Once. And just this weekend, I binged the Netflix show,
Beef. I'm going to try to break down the main themes.
Actually since I just finished Beef and it's still raw, this is going to be 95% about Beef.

  At their cores, both films talk a lot about a lack of communication. Not just a lack of any communication,
but authentic, untethered communication.
(There's also a lot of ass-kissing, enough to make you puke, and enough to dedicate a section to, but I won't because
everyone knows about ass-kissing already).

  There is a distinction between the two types of communication in Beef:

- Surface-level, time-filling, formality communication; we do this one a lot with liminal, acquaintance-type relations

- Unfiltered, direct, forward-moving communication; our inner-dialogue that we only share with a select few (sometimes only ourselves).


The first type of communication can build up many suppressed feelings. As Jordan, the rich, white lady mentions,
even she needs a no-filter group to talk with.
Too much surface-level talk feels like a dam about to burst.


It always bursts.

*random sidebar time!*

I feel like people use weed to disinhibit and talk freely, it's like an agreement where all parties (ideally) lower the gates,
and can reach a better level of understanding with each other.


It's weird that we need this whole ritual just to be honest with each other. But many people (including me) are scared to be honest because we care too much what other people think.
It could be worth trying to just talk more honestly and brusquely in the day-to-day, but that often requires a lot of explainging after-the-fact.


I also hate professionalism. The way it is right now.


I feel like we can talk authentically in a way that's still standardized enough to benefit work-efficiency at the same time.
Recently, in my NLP class there was an example of investigating power through parsing email text among a company workforce.
The whole time I was thinking how much less stressful and more efficient a less linguistically-professional workforce would be.


Sorry for all the sidebars, I just ran off like a runaway train there. Now trauma.

Trauma is such a general term. Does it just mean a pain that iterates? Does it have to do with the magnitude of the pain?


It's very complicated, and the type in these films, generational trauma, is even more complicated.
Generational trauma is always talked about like something inevitable, like Thanos or something.
Something that has to be overcome personally, stopped at one link within the chain.
I think EEAAO (everything everywhere all at once) made a nice cheesy-but-powerful-in-the-moment scene where the whole family pitches in to save the daughter.
Teamwork makes the dream work!


From what I've seen, some/many asian cultures also believe in holding things in, there's just a lot of suppression in general.
It may initially come from a good place. Not wanting to pass down the trauma, but I think this approach could really just be contributing to more generational trauma.
While, it may seem logical to withhold this pain from your kid, it's probably more productive in the long run to be open and communicative.


A distant parent can make a child think they can't be trusted. Children (and people) like to overthink. I've put a lot of thought into that one.
This just ties again into communication -- the honest kind.


A lot of people are pretty aware, they probably know what their trauma is caused by, or they eventually come to find out.
So, it's better to just be open and not treat others like babies. I don't think it's something that always needs treatment or overcoming.
It's something that happened, it's a part of the past, embracing it openly. There's nothing to be shameful of.

The last topic I wanted to talk about was depression. Emptiness.
A strange, origin-less, ambiguous, unknowing, difficult-to-grasp feeling at times.
This one's difficult to talk about because of the ambiguity.


It can easily be ignored at any point, but that could also just because you've been in the void so long.


There's a lot of denial. It's often tied into bad habits. It's a lot to handle when measured in its entirety,
but its usually very spread out, very "ambiguous", as I seem to keep saying. That's what makes it so difficult to resolve.


It's not always big things that lead to it either. It could be many small things that build it up and one thing triggers it.
It's not always something that breaches a level of awareness.
Last week, I just watched 10 minutes of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and it dampened my mood immediately.
Maybe some suppressed bad memories. Probably.


The only advice I have for this one is to start small. There are many small things contributing to this big thing.
So the only way to solve it is to approach the small things one at a time.


I realized I haven't talked about how depression is covered in the films at all, but this'll have to do.
My right eye is starting to strain. The small thing I will do now is sign off.


Go watch Beef, it's depressing, but also feels necessary to watch if you're feeling down.
