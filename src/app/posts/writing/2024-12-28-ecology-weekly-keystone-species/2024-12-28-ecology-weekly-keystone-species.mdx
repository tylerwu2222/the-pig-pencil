Hi! This is the first entry in what I'm hoping to make a weekly, probably bi-weekly, series about topics in ecology. 
I plan to keep these short(ish) and sweet. Each time focusing on one concept and its related concepts.

I've always loved ecology since high school, when I first studied it in Science Olympiad. 

The beauty of ecology is that the topics are all interconnected, 
and there's probably a lifetime's worth of interesting facts and relationships I could talk about.  

That makes it hard to choose where to start, but we have to start somewhere.
So to kick off this series, I'll talk about a concept that I think represents some big ideas very well: *keystone species*.

<ScrollspyHeader header="what does keystone mean?"/>
The first time I heard the term "keystone", it was from the term keystone species. 
Years later, I actually looked up what a keystone is. It's one of these things:
<Image src={w1} alt="keystone in place"/>

And if you remove it, this might happen:
<Image src={w2} alt="keystone out of place"/>

So, in terms of ecology, a keystone species is one that "defines" an ecosystem. 
Such that, if it were removed, the ecosystem would be "dramatically" different ([Nat Geo](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/role-keystone-species-ecosystem/)).

<ScrollspyHeader header="who coined the term?"/>
The term keystone species was coined by the American ecologist [Robert T. Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_T._Paine_(zoologist)) while he was a fellow at the University of Washington. 
The key experiment that precipitated this term took place in 1963, when Paine was studying <ClickDefinitionText hoverText={'shallow pools in the rock face that appear when the tide recedes'} link={'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_pool'}>tide pool</ClickDefinitionText> communities. 

In this community, there were two key players: the [Purple Sea Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisaster_ochraceus) and the [California Mussel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_mussel):
<Image src={w3} alt="sea star and mussel"/>

The Mussel eats primarily plankton that it filters out of that water. The Star eats a little bit of everything, including, importantly, the Mussel.

Paine was curious what would happen if he *removed* the sea star entirely. 
To do this, he used a crowbar to pry up any sea stars, and repeatedly chucked it into the tide. 
(Repeatedly because presumably the sea star kept crawling back.)

After some time, he found that the pools without the stars became <ClickDefinitionText hoverText={'habitats dominated primarily by one species. This can occur naturally or through human intervention.'} link={'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_pool'}>monocultures</ClickDefinitionText> **dominated by mussels**.
Without the sea star there to keep its population in check, the mussel ran rampant, having free reign to expand and crowd out other species in the pool.

This finding challenged the predominant view in ecology at the time -- that having diversity in a habitat was enough for a thriving ecosystem.
Paine's experiment suggested that while all species play their role in the ecosystem, some species have more essential roles than others. 

<ScrollspyHeader header="what qualifies as keystone?"/>
But what makes some roles more essential than others? How do we measure this "essentialness" that qualifies some species as keystone species? 
One concept we can measure this with is "functional redundancy". The less redundant (more unique) the function or role a species plays, 
the more important that species is to the ecosystem as a whole. 

For example, say three species of fish are responsible for grazing on a coral. 
If one happens to disappear, that would be unfortunate, but its likely the other two fish species could compensate.

On the other hand, in the Paine experiment the purple sea star has low functional redundancy, 
(in fact it was a one of one), in the role as "mussel eater". 
Once the sea star was removed, no other species could effectively step in to fill the "mussel eater" role.

Aside from the uniqueness of the role, the other logical factors to consider are the breadth and depth of a species' impact. 
Whether through consumption, movement, shelter-building, or any other activities, each animal leaves a footprint on the environment.

And each action does not just end at the direct recipient of that action. 
Each action has a "cascading" cause and effect chain on that actions recipient, that recipient's recipient, and so on... 

<ScrollspyHeader header="trophic cascades (chain reactions)"/>
A central pattern in ecology is cause and effect. relationships. When a predator population grows, its prey population shrinks, and vice versa. 
Everything affects everything else to some degree, whether through direct interaction or some nth-degree interaction. 

To better illustrate this idea, here's a very simplified "interactive" food web representing a segment of the aforementioned tide pool ecosystem.
Try changing the slider to see how changing the sea star population might hypothetically affect other species in the short-term.

*Note*: the mussel eats algae, but it does not directly consume anemone, rather it out-competes anemone for space.

Removing the starfish in the above network causes <ClickDefinitionText hoverText={'the resulting change in different species population levels that occur as a result of dramatic change to one particularly essential species'} link={'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_cascade'}>*trophic cascade*</ClickDefinitionText>.
The type of cascade that Paine witnessed is called *top-down cascade*, since it was the change in a top-level predator, that caused the downward wave of population shifts. If something were to heavily impact the primary producers (e.g. plants) of an ecosystem, that would be a *bottom-up cascade*.

In the ecological world, things are often dependent on other things.

<ScrollspyHeader header="more examples"/>
While the typical examples are usually predators, 
there are also other types of roles that could have keystone-level impacts.

<ScrollspyHeader header="wolves" level={3} include={false}/>
The wolf (and its related food web) was actually what inspired the [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_cascade#Origins_and_theory) of trophic cascade. 
American ecologist Aldo Leopold observed that as hunters hunted wolves in an area, 
the deer that the wolves preyed upon were allowed to live and repopulate, leading to overgrazing of the mountains.

<ScrollspyHeader header="elephants" level={3} include={false}/>
As herbivores in the savannah, elephants play a key role in uprooting trees and eating saplings, preventing the grasslands from turning into forests.
In addition, they also dig up dry riverbeds to create watering holes for themselves (and other animals). 
In this way they act as <ClickDefinitionText hoverText={'organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials'} link={'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/ecosystem-engineers#:~:text=Ecosystem%20engineers%20are%20organisms%20that,.%2C%201994%2C%201997).'}>ecosystem engineers</ClickDefinitionText>
Without them, many plain animals like zebras would not be able to thrive in the same way.

<ScrollspyHeader header="beavers" level={3} include={false}/>
Beavers are another ecosystem engineer that physically defines the unique riparian ecosystem. 
While you might initially expect dams to cause floods, in reality, their dams help modulate water flow preventing flooding, 
and provide a more consistent wetland habitat to its inhabitants. You can read more about all the good things beavers do [here](https://environmentamerica.org/articles/beavers-are-ecosystem-engineers-and-fight-climate-change-too/).

Some other keystone species include bees, ants, termites, coral, and saguaro cacti. I'll leave it as an exercise for you to Google/think about why.

<hr/>
Hopefully, this week you learned a bit about what a keystone species is and how different species play different roles of varying importance. 
Next time, we will be talking about these roles, (in ecology called a "niche"), and how these roles arise through competition.

<ScrollspyHeader header="further readings"/>
1) [Life Between the Tides](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Between-Tides-Adam-Nicolson/dp/0374251436), by Adam Nicolson. I've been wanting to write about ecology for a long time, and this was the book that recently inspired me to do so. It also introduced me the origin story of the term "keystone species". 
It's a neat little book that talks about a man who created a few tide pools and the different visitors that came and went to these pools.
2) [Role of Keystone Species in an Ecosystem (National Geographic)](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/role-keystone-species-ecosystem/). I think this is a nice synopsis of keystone species and some other related terms used to describe species.
