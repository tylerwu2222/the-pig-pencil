At this point you might be wondering, can there only be one keystone species per ecosystem? Well, maybe. With ecology, (and lots of things), there are few absolutes. 

When thinking about this, I came up with a weird analogy to machine learning, (that may not click with everyone), but I think it's a pretty good connection. 

In machine learning we define models, or simply, equations that predict some result (y) from a set of variables (x1,x2,...). Think back to the equation of a line (y=mx+b).
To provide an example, I could simplify Paine's tide pool ecosystem as something like:

change_in_ecosystem = (presence_of_sea_star) + (presence_of_mussel) + (presence_of_kelp) ...

Now, imagine the "presence" of a species as between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning no members, and 1 meaning equal to the initial population size of the species.

If we set the weight of the sea star to 0, (as Paine effectively did when he threw the star repeatedly), we can then measure then change in ecosystem using some numeric representation.

Yet *another* comparison between keystone species and ML modeling is "functional redundancy". Nat Geo explains low functional redundancy as: "if the species were to disappear from the ecosystem, no other species would be able to fill its ecological niche."
This is extremely similar to the concept of "feature importance" in ML. 

Essentially, how "unique" is the impact of a predictor x on the result y. With sea stars, it's difficult to find another predator that can easily step in to clean up mussels. But, with oxygen producers, there might be more than 1 candidate.

A related theory to keystone species is what's called the "Green World Hypothesis". 
It states that the world is green because of predators that keep <HoverDefinitionText hoverText={'a plant-eater'}>herbivore</HoverDefinitionText> populations in check. 
By controlling the herbivore population, the predators reduce the major consumers of plants and, thus, are primarily responsible for the "Green World".
