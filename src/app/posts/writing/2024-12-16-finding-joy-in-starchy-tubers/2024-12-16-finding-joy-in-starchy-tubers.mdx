<ScrollspyHeader header="Finding joy in starchy tubers"/>
	
Most people could improve their quality of life if they made 
a bit of effort to explore the expansive world of starchy root vegetables! 
Many people stick with the standard orange sweet potato, russet or gold potatoes, 
carrots, and the occasional radish or beet. 

In reality, there are a multitude of varieties of root vegetables that many Americans haven't tried, 
and they all offer unique and valuable visual qualities, nutritional benefits, and flavor profiles. 

I am going to showcase some of my favorite starchy tubers in no particular order!

<ScrollspyHeader header="Okinawan sweet potato"/>

<Image src={tuber_okinawan} className="object-cover w-full h-full inset-x-0 -translate-y-5 m-0" alt="tuber, okinawan sweet potato"/>
</div>

This sweet potato has a humble <span>pale brown-gray exterior</span>, but a luxurious <span>deep purple interior</span>. 

This tuber is fantastic in sweet applications and is best steamed rather than baked or roasted due to the dry dense flesh. 
My favorite way to eat okinawan sweet potato is to blend the cooled flesh with ice and condensed milk! 
This results in a sweet and beautifully purple thick drink that is better than any ube beverage that you could imagine. 

Okinawan sweet potatoes are often found in Asian supermarkets.

<LightCallout>
**Note:** Okinawan sweet potato is often mistaken for the Stokes purple sweet potato or ube. 
The Stokes sweet potato has a darker skin and typically has a redder hue to the flesh and 
is less sweet than the Okinawan sweet potato, which is why I believe that the Okinawan sweet potato is superior. 
</LightCallout>

Ube, on the other hand, is a yam (not a sweet potato) with a hairy exterior. 
Ube is actually not sweet in the slightest without the addition of sugar and has a very slimy flesh. 
Ube really needs to be doctored up with many other additions to taste good in dessert applications, 
which is why I also believe that the Okinawan sweet potato is superior. 

<ScrollspyHeader header="Japanese sweet potato"/>
<div className="relative w-1/2 aspect-[2] overflow-hidden">
<Image src={tuber_jap_sweet} className="object-cover w-full h-full inset-x-0 m-0" alt="tuber, japanese sweet potato"/>
</div>
The Japanese sweet potato has a <span>burgundy-red</span> skin and <span>creamy pale yellow</span> flesh. 

This is a fantastic all-rounder sweet potato that can be baked or steamed without becoming too dry or too soggy either way. 

My personal favorite way to cook them is to roast them in tin foil until the sugars start to caramelize. 

Japanese sweet potatoes are great in both sweet and savory applications. 
- Many people enjoy them with kimchi or as a side to a protein such as fish. 
- They are also delicious drizzled with some [honey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3q1utveztM) and nut butter. 
- This sweet potato is also great when eaten in a half-frozen state after roasting and adopts an ice cream-like consistency. 

There are endless ways to enjoy this versatile sweet potato, 
and it is fortunately becoming more widely available in American grocery stores as well.

<ScrollspyHeader header="Taro"/>
<div className="relative w-1/2 overflow-hidden">
<Image src={tuber_taro} className="object-cover w-full h-full inset-x-0 m-0" alt="tuber, taro"/>
</div>
Taro is another root vegetable that many people have heard of, but never actually cooked from scratch. It has a hairy brown exterior and creamy white flesh speckled with purple fibers. 

Taro is part of the yam family and is toxic when it is raw, so it is important to cook it thoroughly. 
It is also a good idea to wear gloves when cutting raw taro since it releases a sticky latex-like substance that can irritate the skin. 

Most people have eaten taro in sweet applications such as taro boba, 
but taro is also great in savory applications such as 
- [sinigang](https://panlasangpinoy.com/pork-sinigang-na-baboy-recipe/)
- hot pot
- [taro cakes](https://thewoksoflife.com/taro-cake-wu-tao-gou/)
- taro chips
- Hawaiian poi
- and more..

Additionally, most taro boba barely has any real taro (if any), and has a very artificial flavor. 

This is why I think that everyone should experience the joy of preparing and eating taro from its raw form! 
Taro has a slightly earthy flavor that I personally find reminiscent of wooden popsicle sticks, 
but it complements both sweet and savory flavors remarkably well. 

I love making a sweet paste out of taro and sugar or condensed milk and spreading it on thick bread or topping it on some oatmeal.

<LightCallout>
**Note:** There are both small and large varieties of taro. 
The large variety is a lot milder in flavor and more starchy, 
while the smaller variety can sometimes be more slimy and have a sour aftertaste. 
I prefer the large variety for most applications, 
but the small ones can be good in savory soups such as sinigang 
or hot pot because they don't disintegrate in boiling broth as easily.

<ScrollspyHeader header="Daikon radish"/>
<div className="relative w-1/2 aspect-[7/4] overflow-hidden">
<Image src={tuber_daikon} className="object-cover w-full h-full inset-x-0 m-0" alt="tuber, daikon"/>
</div>
There are many varieties of radishes, 
but I truly believe that daikon radishes are the most versatile because they are very mild in comparison to spicier or earthier radishes. 

They can be 
- pickled
- fermented into kimchi
- made into radish cakes
- stir fried in strips
- dried
- or cooked in soup

I really enjoy having them in soups because they stay firm and 
retain a nice crunch even after simmering for a long time. 

I also accidentally discovered that despite their high moisture content, 
they don't become flaccid and soggy after freezing like lots of other vegetables do. 

It is also a great source of fiber while being low in calories, 
so it is a great food for people trying to lose weight!

<ScrollspyHeader header="Parsnips"/>
<div className="relative w-1/2 aspect-[7/4] overflow-hidden">
<Image src={tuber_parsnip} className="object-cover w-full h-full inset-x-0 m-0" alt="tuber, parsnip"/>
</div>
Parsnips are another root vegetable that is commonly stocked in grocery stores but 
seems to be largely untouched. 

Although they look just like pale carrots, they have a completely different flavor profile. 
If fall could be represented by a vegetable, I think it would be parsnips! 

The flavor is reminiscent of cinnamon and nutmeg, and is slightly sweet. 
The inside turns creamy when roasted, and the smell of fall is guaranteed to waft out of your oven! 

Parsnips can also be pureed into a silky hearty soup, 
and solid hunks are a great addition to pot roasts. 
Most people eat parsnips in savory applications, 
but I have also enjoyed them dusted in cinnamon and drizzled in honey.

<ScrollspyHeader header="Mountain yam"/>
<div className="relative w-1/2 aspect-[7/4] overflow-hidden">
<Image src={tuber_mount_yam} className="object-cover w-full h-full inset-x-0 m-0" alt="tuber, mountain yam"/>
</div>
Mountain yam (AKA 山药 or nagaimo in Japanese) has 
a bristly pale brown exterior and slimy white interior. 

It can just be stir fried or incorporated into soups, 
but many Japanese recipes actually take advantage of 
the stretchy sliminess and grate this yam into a paste. 

The yam can then be incorporated into pancakes like okonomiyaki as a textural enhancement or 
served as a dollop on a warm bowl of soupy noodles. 
There aren't many other root vegetables with this exact texture, 
so I think that everyone should give it a try at least once! 

There are also a lot of Chinese powdered sweet cereals (such as by the brand Greenmax)
that include mountain yam, which contributes to the thick starchy texture of the cereal and 
also confers health benefits. 
 
It is easiest to find raw mountain yam in Asian grocery stores.
