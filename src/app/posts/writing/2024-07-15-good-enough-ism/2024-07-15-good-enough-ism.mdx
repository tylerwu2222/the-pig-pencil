Today, I'll be writing about the pros and cons of perfectionism vs. "good-enough-ism".

At the surface it makes some sense. We want something that we care about to be the best that it can be.

But, really, aside from those super high-stakes or specialized tasks, 
really how many of these situations in our day-to-day life truly require a perfect or close-to-perfect outcome?

Even in those more demanding situations, we know that perfect is moreso a pursuit or slogan, 
rather than a true metric to measure.

While I believe learning anything with dedication and craft early on is good, there is always a point, an inflection point,
where the amount of work we have to put in to eek out that tiny bit of improvement is probably 
not worth it for the average human.

For some it might always be worth it to keep pushing. For example, for a pro athelte at the apex of their sport, 
a 0.01% improvement on top of their already 99th-percentile abilty could be worth it, reputationally and financially.
Whereas for me, someone who plays sports as a hobby, it's not worth it to max out something random like my vertical jumping ability.

This is where I propose "good-enough-ism" as an alternative to perfectionism. You may already be living this without knowing it. If so, good for you. 
As a former/recovering perfectionist, I had to reason myself to this point through trial-and-error.

My main reasoning behind "good-enough-ism" was basically just considering 
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">diminishing returns</a>. 

If you think about an opitmal or "perfect" life, in an overall sense, then perfectionism towards a particular skill might actually detract from having an overall "perfect" life.
The way to live an overall optimal life might actually be to divert some effort to other things, (friendship, mental and physical health, family, etc.), when we're near the inflection point.

Now, I'm not saying to not go try-hard mode at anything, but rather, to consider this inflection point, and whether or not it's worth it for you, personally, overall, to push
your ability past that point, and if so, by how much. (Basically, this is a more complex way to say balance is good).

A common analogy is in RPGs, (role playing games), where you can invest all your points in one skill, 
say archery or something, and that skill probably helps you easily handle enemies of the flying category.
But then, along comes a melee enemy that attacks you up-close-and-personal, then you're in a pickle. 

Point is, it's probably best to diversify skills and learning after a certain point of specialization.

[Another thing to consider is <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/synergism" target="_blank">synergism</a>. So far, I've been talking about skills in isolation, independent of each other, but in life, 
we often learn concepts from one skill that can be applied to another. 
Learning seemingly unrelated skills can often expand the dimensionality of our approach, and bring a new perspective to an old skill.]

<ScrollspyHeader header='an argument from nature' />
With a lot of issues in my life, I've always liked to look at nature for reasoning. 

As a kid, I always wondered, why don't animals just keep evolving, and keep getting better at what they do? Oh, silly young me.

At that time, I didn't understand that an animal's survival strategy is contextual. Contextual to the biotic and abiotic (living and nonliving) environment. 
Contextual to its own evolutionary history. Contextual to costs and benefits. 

I think when I had this realization—that the natural world is interconnected and with limits—I changed my own world view for how to survive in a similarly, limit-based human world.

In a world with limits, the best strategy is not the mindless pursuit of limitlessness, but understanding the optimal limit. (there's a quote for ya)

More specifically understanding where and how much effort to allocate (aka finding your niche).

And once you have, that's good enough.
