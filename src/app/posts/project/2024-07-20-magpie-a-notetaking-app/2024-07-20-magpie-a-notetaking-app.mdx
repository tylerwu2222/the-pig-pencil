<ScrollspyHeader header={'Motivations'}/>
Everyone seems to have their favorite notetaking/productivity app, and I'm no different. 

For me, I've been using a combination of [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) on my phone for daily planning and small notes, 
and [Microsoft OneNote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_OneNote) (the desktop app) on my laptop for planning larger projects, (usually coding projects), 
or taking notes for when I'm learning something new, (usually a coding language).

Anyway, when I made this app, it was a time where I was interviewing for a lot of startups for full-stack positions, and the more I interviewed, 
the more I realized I needed more experience building back-ends.

I also really wanted to try making a note-taking app, so 2 birds 1 stone. 


<ScrollspyHeader header={'Tech Stack'}/>
<span className="underline">Front-end:</span>
- React Native
- Expo

<span className="underline">Data/back-end:</span>
- Express (for creating API routes)
- Supabase (for hosting PostgreSQL database and handling authentication)

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Database Schema'}/>
(will add a nice drawing here in the future)

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Design'}/>
Here are a couple of my sketches designing core screens/components:

    </div>

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Core Features'}/>
Initially, I wanted to create some revolutionary collection management app that rethought how information is organized, but then I came back to Earth and decided I needed to walk before I could run.

So, I started by telling myself I would try to recreate Google Keep's mobile app the best I could. Then add some features I wanted after.

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Create Note'} level={3}/>
This feature involved a few steps:
1. Pressing the create note button would render the `<NewNote/>` component which was essentially a blank note interface for the user to define data for the note.
2. When a user makes changes to the title/description, I track these changes in state variables in React.
3. When the user closes/saves the `<NewNote/>` I would make a POST request to my backend to create a new, row with the state variable data that the user entered.
Additionally, when the user closes the note, I also trigger a callback function that refetches all the notes, so the new note the user created would show up in the interface for showing all notes.

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Edit Note'} level={3}/>
This is similar to the Create Note flow, but instead of opening a `<NewNote/>` component, I render a `Note` component that fetches the data for that note ID.
1. User presses a note, with an associated noteID. This triggers a GET request to fetch data for that note, and render the `Note` with that data.
2. Any changes the user makes to the `Note` will be again sent to the database, this time with a PATCH request (partial update of existing entry) instead of a POST request (create new entry).

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Authentication'} level={3}/>
Done with Supabase authentication. This was a lot of following guides and tutorials...
(expand on this later)

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Fun Features'}/>
<ScrollspyHeader header={'Long-press Action Menu'} level={3}/>
This feature was probably the one I enjoyed making the most. It was done using the [GestureHandler]() package, (super fun) and also an animation package,.

Essentially, the GestureHandler package adds a listener for "long press" on my notes, and when that triggers, I trigger the following UI changes:

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    <div>
    *deleting a note*
    <img className="h-[70vh]" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExM3VydWx0bzR3ZjZ3djF3dDZsM3cyZDI4a3hwOXpxZ3EybGJnNWtmdCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/Gk6Gegz2zr2Nk2cLfp/giphy.gif" alt="delete note"/>
    </div>
    <div>
    *duplicating a note*
    <img className="h-[70vh]" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExajUzaXBreGpneDFkbWEwZzQ2b212Y3h2ZG14NTdqaTZraHJubWQ1NyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/DusPcUthzowZPJGRBG/giphy.gif" alt="duplicate note"/>
    </div>
</div>


<ScrollspyHeader header={'Aging Notes'} level={3}/>
This idea came about when I was thinking about how as information grows in size, it inevitably becomes harder and harder to manage and parse.

After some brainstorming, I came up with the idea of using color, specifically luminosity, to provide information on all your notes "at a glance".

The idea is essentially to correlate the age of a note with how "dull" the background is, that way frequently visited notes remain fresh and vibrant, 
and old notes that may need to be archived have a subtle, visual indicator. 

<Image className={"h-[70vh] w-auto"} src={aging_notes} alt="aging_notes"/>

This idea was one that I was pretty proud of, showing that some ideas don't require complex code, but rather a clean design.

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Changing View'} level={3}/>
This feature also made use of the GestureHandler and animation package. Long pressing the view button would slide open the view toolbar, and releasing above a view icon would rerender the notes in that format.

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Learnings & Challenges'}/>
One of the biggest things I learned from this project is it's important to set up the "boring" stuff first, before diving into more "fun" front-end features and interactions.

For this project, the most glaring features I should have build out first was authentication. Because in the MVP of the app, each user only accesses *their own* notes.

<ScrollspyHeader header={'Reflection'}/>
This project taught me a lot about building my own backend as well as how to setup Authentication .
