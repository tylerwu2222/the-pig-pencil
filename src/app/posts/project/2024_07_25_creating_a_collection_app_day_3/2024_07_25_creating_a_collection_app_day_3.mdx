For any data-related project I've worked on the last few years, 
I always create a local .json file to emulate a backend so I can flesh out the UI.

I used the Modal component from RN paper to wrap my existing card component --except the card shown in the modal would be editable.
In other words, the card shown in the first view to the user would essentially just be a fancy button to open the modal view:

So I just duplicated my "static card", and toggled the editable prop to on, which corresponded to rendering text as textInputs instead.

I first tried using a react-native community package, but there was some linking issue or something, idk. 
So I tried the expo blurView, which worked great

Next time I will work on building a more traditional "gallery" view as seen in photo apps and CCGs (computer card games).
