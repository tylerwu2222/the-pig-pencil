--So I forgot to mention I was going to be travelling for a month in China. And when I got back, I had
to do a couple ✨coding assignments✨ from tech companies. That took a whole week, but that's over for now. 
While I was in China, I had pretty limited internet access, 
and had trouble coding without the assistance of stack overflow + documentation as relatively new to mobile dev.

With nothing much to do in the 100 degree heat, I started looking through textbooks I'd downloaded (yes, I'm like that). And found that,
in the past, I had downloaded the PDF for a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Front-end-Architecture-Development-Components/dp/1484266242" target="_blank">Modern front-end architecture</a>. 
I only read a few chapters, but one of the most useful concepts I learned about in this book was "component-driven development" (CDD). You can read more about it <a href="https://www.componentdriven.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.

The idea is that we should build out our components from the bottom up before jumping into designing entire pages.

This makes sense for apps that might see multiple, reusable components. We want to first ensure that a component works independently and in its different states, 
rather than building the component shoddily within a complex system, 
and needing to navigate a mess of dependent components when changes need to be made.
The author relates it to the idea of "mise en place" or having <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2kRFrWaLWiKq48YYVdGcm8"><i>everything in its right place</i></a> before you start building.

A metaphor I think of is having a test-kitchen for working on ingredients, (base components), and recipes, (composite components), before adding them to the menu (pages/screens). 
That way, when its time to put the recipes and menu together it is just that — putting ingredients together — rather than needing to go back mid-cooking to redo a whole ingredient.

To help in building these components, I employed a library called Storybook.js. 
It helps you isolate your components so they're easier to work on. I first started by making my own button components,
before I remembered that I could just use component libraries. These are pre-existing libraries that other people built with styled components that you can use and further customize (thanks other people!).
For reference, I used one called <a href="https://reactnativepaper.com/" target="_blank">react-native-paper</a>.
 
Here are some screenshots of the Storybook UI with a react-native-paper button:

<div className='verticalCenterContainer'>
    <img
        className='articleImg' 
        src="/img/projects/magpie/day2/storybookUI1.png"
        alt="storybook ui 1"
    />
    <i>all the components and stories</i>
</div>

<div className='verticalCenterContainer'>
    <img
        className='articleImg' 
        src="/img/projects/magpie/day2/storybookUI2.png"
        alt="storybook ui 2"
    />
    <i>can edit component props easily in the storybook UI</i>
</div>

<div className='verticalCenterContainer'>
    <img
        className='articleImg' 
        src="/img/projects/magpie/day2/storybookUI3.png"
        alt="storybook ui 3"
    />
    <i>and other things like changing the background</i>
</div>

So yeah it's pretty nice, and if you need to show a coworker or somebody a single component, it's pretty straightforward.

### Making a card
After building some basic components: icon buttons, text buttons, and text inputs, I put a few of these together into a more complex component: a <b>card</b>.

<img
    className='halfWidthImg' 
    src="/img/projects/magpie/day2/card.png"
    alt="card component"
/>

I think the way I want these cards to work is sort of like those in computer card games, (hearthstone, MTG arena, gwent, etc.). 

- Tapping the card should bring up a modal where the user can edit text fields and the image
- Cards should be able to be added to collections/categories, sort of like the save feature on Instagram.
- (Much later on, I want to add sharing with other users too, but for a good while, it'll just be an icon to remind me).

### Making a deck
Since building the modal functionality is probably a little complicated, I decided the last thing I'd do today is aggregate some cards together into a stack or "deck".

<img
    className='halfWidthImg' 
    src="/img/projects/magpie/day2/deck.png"
    alt="deck component"
/>

Doing this simply involved mapping a number array (0,1,2,...,5) to my card component, and offsetting each card based on the index. 

In the long-run, I'll have to set up the back-end system to store card data, and map that data to the cards in this deck component.

<ScrollspyHeader/>
Something I realized while making the card and deck components was that I kind of wanted to reframe the idea for my app.

- Maybe instead of this intense, algorithm, data-visualization-heavy, all-in-one, collection app,
 I could instead make a sort of lightweight, annotated photo gallery that manifests itself in digital/tangible cards. 

- This could also enable that desire to collect and show off cards with others, 
(thinking back to how kids like to collect trading cards and share their collections with friends), 
 but instead turning the photo gallery on everyone's phone into fun, sharable cards.

- I'm thinking something similar to Google Keep, (a lightweight note-taker that's flexibility and versatility comes from it's simplicty), 
but with a bit more elements of collection and categorization to enhance the satisfaction of looking at your collections.

Anyway, my goal for next time is to have the modal functionality for a card set up, 
with a more comprehensive card where I can edit the image and text components.
