Summer 2024. This is the first summer after I've graduated for the last time.

I should be applying to jobs, which I am, but it does feel a bit discouraging.

To be honest though, I still kinda wanna make one more personal project start-to-finish. Because when else would I have this much time again?

<ScrollspyHeader />
I spent this last summer cooking up a mobile app for <a href="https://github.com/tylerwu2222/youzi-mobile/tree/main" target="_blank">learning Chinese</a> with a few groupmates.
It was a lot of work, and in hindsight, I realized I should have kept better track of my progress. I took some notes on useful packages and techniques, 
but not nearly in as structured, or as useful a way as I would've liked.

Also, while that project was a great learning experience, and I was truly excited and proud of what our team was able to make,
it wasn't the project I really wanted to make deep down.

What I'll work on this summer is a collection management app I have been thinking about for the last half year or so.
The working name will be called Magpie, because of the trope that Magpies collect shiny objects for the nest. Studies have shown is probably not actually true, but whatever.

<div className='verticalCenterContainer'>
    <img
        className='halfWidthImg' 
        src="/img/projects/magpie/day1/magpie.png"
        alt="a magpie"
    />
    <i>a magpie</i>
</div>


Regardless, the inspiration for making this app is a personal issue I run into time and time again when managing growing collections,
be it desktop files, bookmarks, instagram collections for art reference, etc. The issue is that, as the collection grows and grows, 
it becomes more and more time consuming to browse or access elements from that collection.

I'll just arbitrarily dub this phenomenon the "collection size overflow" (CSO) problem to make it sound more official.

This issue arises because most collection formats are fundamentally "one-dimensional". 
They are either a big list you can sort and filter, or a collection of files nested within a folder within a folder. 
Once these 1D collections reach a certain size, it becomes tedious to parse through.

Frankly, it's also a bit boring to look through these lists. Personally, as a collector, 
I think part of the appeal of collecting something is just being able to sit back and marvel and easily flip through said collection - think stampbook, or photo album.
Currently, most digital collections you have to endlessly, unidirectionally swipe your thumb through a huge scrollable div, (or occassional click next page).
Not super fun imo.

A search feature and filters somewhat addresses the parsing problem, but it depends on you remembering the exact right keyword or when you collected that item.
Google photos is pretty good at dealing with this with auto-tagging your images with image recognition AI.

My current idea for how to address this is to come up with novel ways to structure and view collections. Here are some current shooting-from-the-hip ideas:
<div className='flexImgContainer'>
    <div className='verticalCenterContainer'>
        <img
            className='halfWidthImg' 
            src="/img/projects/magpie/day1/pile_timeline.jpg"
            alt="pile and timeline view"
        />
        <i>Pile and timeline view</i>
    </div>
    <div className='verticalCenterContainer'>
        <img
            className='halfWidthImg' 
            src="/img/projects/magpie/day1/pairs_completion.jpg"
            alt="pairs and completion view"
        />
        <i>Pairs and completion view</i>
    </div>
</div>

These are definitely not the most novel or perfect, but I'm still working on it™️.

I should also mention another source of inspiration for this project is that I like to draw. 
Saving inspirational reference art is super important for me.
The problem is it's difficult to decide where to save inspo, and it's also difficult to find it again later.
Pinterest kind of does this, but it's UI is a bit lacking imo.

Anyway, in terms of what to expect, you can expect (somewhat) frequent posts that follow along my journey creating this mobile app.
I'll talk about my thinking, issues I run into, and big breakthroughs.

If you'd like to follow along with this journey, feel free to subscribe to my <a href="https://thepigpencil.com/subscribe" target="_blank">newsletter</a> (this is under the Projects section).

And if you want to check out my code, I'll include snippets throughout posts, but unfortunately, 
I don't plan on making this project open-source in case I do monetize it one day (just keeping it real).

Anyway that's all for this post. Just wanted to introduce my summer project.

-bye for now
