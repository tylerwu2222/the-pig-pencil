--So I forgot to mention I was going to be travelling for a month in China. While there, I had pretty limited internet access, 
and had trouble coding without the help of the internet and GPT, (I'm still relatively new with mobile dev).

With nothing much to do, I found that in the past, I had downloaded a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Front-end-Architecture-Development-Components/dp/1484266242" target="_blank">Modern front-end architecture</a>. 
One of the most useful concepts I learned about in this book was "component-driven development" (CDD). You can read more about it <a href="https://www.componentdriven.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.

The idea is that we should build out our components from the bottom up before jumping into designing pages ("page-based development").
This makes sense for apps that might see multiple, reusable components. We want to ensure that a component works independently and in its many states, 
rather than building one shoddily and working retroactively when we need to expand functionality or when an issue appears.

This isn't some revolutionary idea, and it's the author relates it to the idea of "mise en place" or everything in its right place.
A metaphor I think of is a test-kitchen for perfecting ingredients, (simple components), and recipes, (composite components), before adding them into courses and the menu (pages and the whole app). 
With this test kitchen, you could save yourself from serving new ingredients/recipes immediately to your customers when you tweak a signle ingredient, 
but instead make sure they're just right beforehand.

Anyway, this idea made a lot of sense to me, and I planned on jumping right back in to developing my app with this new knowledge, 
but suddenly I got a ✨coding assignment✨ from a tech company -- which will be left unnamed for now because I love mystery -- which I have to complete by this weekend.

So, I know it's super sad news, but I'll probably be taking a brief <i>intermission</i> from making my agnum opus app (again) as I go through this interview process.

I'm trying to document my learning process here each day so that I can keep myself more accountable and organized, kinda like journalling, or an agenda.
Bottom line, these next few days will at least be a more structured grind than if I did my usual head-down studying and notes.

The assingment is a CodeSignal assignment and it seems like it'll be focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 
If you have no interest in that whatsoever, (understandable), then no need to read on.

If you are still here, welcome to day 0.5, (because I have half day).

I spent most of today researching, contemplating, and studying, (and setting this page up).

<h5>Researching</h5>
I first started by researching the assignment online, reading about what CodeSignal was.
Seems like it's something like Leetcode, which I have never touched in my life. But, I guess it's finally time.

<h5>Contemplating</h5>
I took an algorithms class in the past, and a dynamic programming class, both during the pandemic, so that's been out of my mind for a while.

I learned about data structures ages ago, (4-5 years), and I know the common data types from data science from regularly using them: lists, dictionaries, objects, dataframes, etc., 
but haven't worked with other ones I hear about in CS/math fields: hash maps, trees, linked lists, other networks, etc.
So I'll have to practice that.

I'm most familiar with Python & JS, but have done a lot more data work in Python, so I'll use that.

<h5>Studying</h5>
As most do, I started by looking for a crash course on Youtube. 
In this case, I started by checking freecodecamp's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0">5-hr course</a>
I super-skimmed it because it's probably better that I jump into practicing problems.

Here are my summarized notes for this video:
<h3>Algorithms</h3>
- defn: a series of steps you take to solve a problem.

<h3>Data Structures</h3>
